## How to Play

**Objective**: Be the leader of the final empire.

### Rules:
1. Each player picks a secret name (any word that they hope won't be associated with them)
2. The list of secret names is read twice in random order, and players are meant to memorize as many names as they can
	- No recording of any information is allowed
	- The name list can be read again at any point if unanimously agreed by all the remaining leaders
3. Turns are taken clockwise around the circle of players
	- Only leaders of empires take turns
4. The first leader chooses another leader and guesses their secret word
	- If they are wrong, their turn is over, and the next leader can guess
	- If they are right, the other player is now part of their empire and the leader gets to guess again
5. The winner is the last leader standing; the one whose secret name is never guessed

#### Notes:
- When a leader is conquered by another leader, their whole empire goes along with them
- All member of each empire should cooperate to guess the remaining leaders' secret names and protect the secret name of their leader
- Only the leader of an empire can make official guesses; other members can talk, but any guesses don't count as a turn for their empire
